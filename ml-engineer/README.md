# ML Engineer Code Test

The `email_similarity` package contains two main functions; `api.email_similarity` takes in two email addresses and returns a similarity score. The score is calculated based on X distance between the email address feature vectors. You should not modify this function as part of the test. The feature vectors are calculated in `features.features`. Your job is to full in `features.features`. You can run `eval.py` to get a score for how well your features measure email address similarity. After you submit, we will test your features against additional data to gauge how well your features generalise.
